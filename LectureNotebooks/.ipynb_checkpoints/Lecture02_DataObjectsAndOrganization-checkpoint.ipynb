    "## Data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first think of the type of data that we typically collect in psychology and neuroscience. Here is a rough list of the types of variables we typically consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* reaction times\n",
    "* accuracy\n",
    "* choice\n",
    "* treatment group\n",
    "* trial duration\n",
    "* time on task\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Of course there are many more, but this is just an example list. Notice not all the same _type_ of data. But they all fall into one of two classes of _data types_:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quantitiative**: Take numerical values and represent some kind of direct measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Qualitiative**: Take category or label values and place an individual into one of several groups. Each observation can be placed in only one category, and the categories are mutually exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In the list above, _reaction time, trial duration, and time on task_ all reflect **quantitative** data, while _accuracy (correct/incorrect), choice, and treatment group_ all reflect **qualitative** data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Understanding the data type of all of your variables is critical because it defines the assumptions you make in your statistical methods. *Therefore the first step in data science is knowing what your data is in the first place.*\n"

    "## Data files\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know what type of data you'll be working with, you'll have to access it. We can safely assume that you will be starting with data that is stored in a digital file (if you have data in another format then it'll have to be digitized for you to do anything with it). For the purposes of this course, any digital file containing values to be analyized is a **data file**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now data files can reflect many different things. You may have many data files for any given analytical goal. For example, the firing rates of different neurons, recorded in the same experiment, are saved as separate data files or each subject in your experiment may have a single data file that reflects their performance and you wish to analyze across subjects. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind is the format of your data file. In some cases your data will be stored in a format that is easily readible by almost any software environment. We call these **human readable** formats because you can open them up in a text editor and see your data. Examples include:\n",
    "* CSV: comma separated value.\n",
    "* TXT: a text file with characters (e.g., tab, space) that indicate transitions between cells.\n",
    "* XML: Extensible markup language.\n",
    "* JSON: JavaScript object notation, lightweight data-interchange format.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "However, when storing large amounts of information or data with complex hierarchical relationships (or sometimes when evil software companies want to prevent you from using other software), data will be stored in **binary** format. In this case, rather than easily readible text formats, the data is converted into binary form and requires a translator function to read it. Examples of binary formats include:\n",
    "* MAT: Matlab data format\n",
    "* SAV: SPSS data format\n",
    "* R: R data format\n",
    "* HDF5: Hierarchical data format (5th version)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Taken together then, the things you want to know about your data files are:\n",
    "* What information is in each file?\n",
