    "Equation syntax contains 1) variables, 2) numbers, 3) operators. Variables and numbers are typed as is, and operators are commands that control formatting. The underscore _ and the carrot sign ^ are two basic operators that specify the following symbol is a subscript or a superscript. If more than one symbol should be a subscript or superscript, they should be surrounded by {}. Other operators begin with a backslash, such as \\frac for division. A cheat sheet of operators can be found [here](https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/Symbols.pdf). Examples below:\n",
